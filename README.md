## Description
The objective of this AI-powered Python program is to automate the process of web data scraping and sentiment analysis. The program utilizes the Beautiful Soup library to extract relevant information from web pages and applies natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment associated with the extracted data.

## Tasks Automated
1. News Sentiment Analysis: The program can scrape news articles from various news websites and analyze the sentiment associated with each article. It categorizes the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral and provides a sentiment score for each article.

2. Product Review Analysis: Using the program, users can scrape product reviews from e-commerce websites like Amazon. The program analyzes the sentiment expressed in the reviews, identifies any patterns or trends, and provides insights into customer opinions about the product.

3. Social Media Sentiment Analysis: The program can scrape user-generated content from platforms like Twitter or Reddit. It analyzes the sentiment of tweets or comments related to specific topics or keywords, allowing users to gain insights into public opinion on a particular subject.

4. Job Market Analysis: With the program, users can scrape job postings from various job portals. The program analyzes the sentiment associated with job descriptions and identifies trends in the job market, such as changing requirements or fluctuating demand for specific skills.

5. Financial News and Stock Market Sentiment Analysis: By scraping financial news articles and forum discussions, the program analyzes sentiment towards specific stocks or the overall stock market. Users can gain insights into the sentiment of investors and traders and potentially make informed investment decisions.

    'http://example.com/news2'
]
app.run_sentiment_analysis(news_urls)

product_url = 'http://example.com/product'
app.run_sentiment_analysis([product_url])

platform = 'http://example.com/twitter'
keyword = 'python'
search_url = f"{platform}/search?q={keyword}"
app.run_sentiment_analysis([search_url])

job_portal_url = 'http://example.com/jobs'
app.run_sentiment_analysis([job_portal_url])

financial_platform_url = 'http://example.com/stocks'
app.run_sentiment_analysis([financial_platform_url])
